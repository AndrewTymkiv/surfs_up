## Summary
After observing the results from this analysis, it can be concluded that it is a safe bet to open the surf shop in Oahu. The average temperature on the island in both June and December is fairly comfortable and only differs by approximately 3 degrees fahrenheit. Given that June and December are in different seasons and 6 motnhs apart, it is safe to assume that the average temperature would not vary much in the months in between.

In addition to this analysis, another query that would provide valuable information is a query of the average precipitation throughout the year in Oahu.
